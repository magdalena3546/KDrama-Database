1. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the day of the week on ratings
The results of the data analysis regarding the influence of the day of the week on TV show ratings suggest that there is no significant difference in ratings between different days of the week. However, it's worth noting that in the case of this dataset where the range of ratings is narrow, these slight variations may have significance. Additionally, it's observed that Thursday has the highest viewership, while Tuesday has the lowest. Therefore, while the differences in average ratings among individual days are not substantial enough to definitively conclude that the day of the week of airing significantly impacts TV show ratings, it's worth considering the possibility that the airing day may still have some significance in certain contexts.
2. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the network on ratings
The analysis of data regarding different television networks (TVN and jTBC) and their ratings suggests the presence of slight differences between them. The average rating for TVN is 8.96667, while for jTBC it is 8.65714. It's worth noting that the differences between the average ratings are small. Additionally, the range of ratings in both cases is narrow. Therefore, although there are some differences between the networks, they are relatively minor and require further analysis to determine their significance.
3. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the duration on ratings
The analysis of the influence of duration on TV drama ratings suggests that there is a noticeable variation in ratings across different durations. Longer durations, such as those around 100 minutes, tend to have higher average ratings, with some exceptions. However, there isn't a linear correlation between duration and ratings, as some shorter durations also receive high ratings. Therefore, while duration may have some influence on ratings, other factors such as plot quality, acting, and genre may also play significant roles in determining the overall rating of a drama.
4. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the number of episodes on ratings
The analysis of the influence of the number of episodes on TV drama ratings suggests that there is a varied relationship between the two factors. While some numbers of episodes, such as those around 10 or 12, tend to have higher average ratings, there is no clear linear trend between the number of episodes and ratings. TV dramas with a wide range of episode counts receive similar ratings, indicating that the number of episodes alone may not be a significant factor in determining the overall rating.
5. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the year of release on number of episodes
Based on the analysis of average episode numbers in kdramas over the years, it can be concluded that there appears to be a trend of decreasing numbers of episodes over time.
6. Conclusions from the analysis of the impact of the genre on ratings
The analysis of average ratings by genre reveals that while there are variations, the differences in ratings between genres are relatively small. Military-themed dramas have the highest average rating, closely followed by genres like friendship, life, and youth. Based on the results of the ANOVA test, fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no significant difference in ratings among different genres of kdramas.
